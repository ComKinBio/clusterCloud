Repository for the devlopment of clustering particles

The relation for the turbulent clustering effect is based on the following publications:

A similar approach has been implemented in Fluent, the results and the code (supplementary material) can be found here:

A diffusion function for the source terms of the particles has been optionally implemented here as well and is based on the work from:
